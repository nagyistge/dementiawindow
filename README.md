3. *Description* :  Our goal is to analyze MRI data of the NKI dataset first and then try to extend our work to the ADNI dataset by plotting the same type of data (MRI T1) collected on MCI and AD subjects, onto the healthy control curve we are getting from the NKI and predict their distance from that curve. This will be done for a number of MRI and fMRI biomarkers, extracted by a nipype pipeline!
