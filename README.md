3. *Description* : We'll be analyzing cortical thickness values of normal, pre-clinical and clinical populations in pre-determined fronto-parietal ROIs as a function of age, beta amyloid values(for the HBA) and behavioral measures (for the datasets that have made them available). As most of the literature focuses on memory decline in healthy older individuals and Alzheimer's patients, we aim at extending the current knowledge of cognitive decline to the executive functions' field, by correlating cortical thickness measures with behavioral performance on executive functions' tasks that are similar across the datasets.
We'll be using the DLBS dataset as a training set and the ADNI healthy control subsample as a replication set. The HAB dataset will be considered as an explorative pre-clinical set before actually testing the distance of MCI and AD patients from the normal curve.
In this way, by performing this analysis on the full spectrum, we will be able to trace a continuous trajectory between the normal, pre-clinical and clinical population as far as cognitive control decline is concerned.
